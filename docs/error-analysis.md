# Error Analysis

The following console errors were observed:

```
Refused to connect to 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1' â€¦ violates the Content Security Policy directive: "default-src 'self'".
Fetch API cannot load https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1. Refused to connect because it violates the document's Content Security Policy.
TypeError: Failed to fetch
```

## Explanation
1. **Content Security Policy Violation**
   - The browser blocked a request to `jsonplaceholder.typicode.com` because the page's CSP only allowed resources from the same origin (`default-src 'self'`).
2. **Fetch API cannot load**
   - Due to the CSP restriction above, the network request was never sent. The browser reports that the request was refused.
3. **TypeError: Failed to fetch**
   - The JavaScript `fetch` call rejected because the network layer prevented the request. Updating the CSP to include the external domain resolves this error.
