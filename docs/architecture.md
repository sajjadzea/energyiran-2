# Project Architecture

## Overview
This system provides a simple full-stack template using Node.js, Express, and React to deliver a single-page application backed by an API. It connects to an OrientDB database and is packaged for containerized deployment.

## Data Flow
- Client sends request
- Authentication processed
- Business logic executed
- Database accessed
- Response returned

## Performance & Scaling
- Use caching and connection pooling where possible
- Apply code-splitting in React for faster loads
- Consider horizontal scaling via Docker clusters

Troubleshoot tip: Verify environment variables in `.env` before running services.
